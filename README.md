# Facial-Recognition-System
A java desktop app created with JavaSwing that allows the admnistrator to register university students by using their personal information and saving their face by ID, to be able to recognize them later after detecting their face using LBPH algorithm, with the ability to modify their data using a MySQL Database (CRUD operations) and printing them.

User will receive a message that will automatically direct him to Settings page.

After Saving information, Student will be assigned an ID.

After Detecting the face, Student is recognized by the LBPH Algorithm and the system shows  the suitable information.

User should click Edit to be able to modify Data in Controls and After clicking Print button in Records page, the system will generate a pdf file containing data about the selected student in the table.

After getting familiar with some basics in computer vision domain, we have build a desktop application for a university , capable of  registering student's faces and identifying them later using LBPH algorithm by showing their personal information, finally fetching and tracking Data by modifying and printing them.
